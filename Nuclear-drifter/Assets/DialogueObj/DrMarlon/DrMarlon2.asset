  - choice: Before entering here I met some thugs! Who were these people?
    reply: They were my bodyguards! They protected me and searched for materials
      for me to run the power plant. They were quite good at it. I don't know where
      I can find such good workers now.

  - choice: How did you find this hidden reactor?
    reply: Six years ago when I was still living in Watown I found an old newspaper
      from 2077. In one of the articles there was a story about a new nuclear reactor.
      After reading that article, I started wandering around Old Zealand until I
      found it under the FoodMart.

  - choice: Do you know where the deposits of uranium from the subway are?
    reply: "I know where the deposits are! They're in the warehouse at the end of
      this corridor. I won't give them to anyone! \nI need them to start the reactor."
