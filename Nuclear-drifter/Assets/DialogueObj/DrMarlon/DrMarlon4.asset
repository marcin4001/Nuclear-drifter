  - choice: What should I do for you?
    reply: I need graphite to create moderators for the reactor. It can be found
      in a mine northwest of here. I can't go there myself it is very dangerous there.
      There are cyclops there. If you bring me 12 packages of graphite I will share
      the elergy with the rest of the continent. If you want to return to the main
      part of the continent you can use the boat, which is located east of the FoodMart.
