  - choice: What will you do next?
    reply: Now I will try to start the reactor. When this is successful I will start
      looking for customers for a new energy source. I think that in a year's time
      every house will be drawing energy from my power plant.

  - choice: Can you repeat where the uranium warehouse is?
    reply: The uranium warehouse is at the end of the corridor. Be careful there
      is a lot of radiation. If you get too much radiation, there is a Rad Killer
      in the chest.

  - choice: How did you find this hidden reactor?
    reply: "\rSix years ago when I was still living in Watown I found an old newspaper
      from 2077. In one of the articles there was a story about a new nuclear reactor.
      After reading that article, I started wandering around Old Zealand until I
      found it under the FoodMart."
