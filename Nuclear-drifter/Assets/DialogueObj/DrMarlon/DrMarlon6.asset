  - choice: I brought the 12 packages of graphite from the mine you asked for.
    reply: Excellent! Now I will now be able to deliver clean energy across the continent.
      I just opened the door to the warehouse at the end of the corridor. You can
      take some cans of uranium from there and give them to your contractors. Just
      be careful because there is a lot of radiation there.

  - choice: How did you find this hidden reactor?
    reply: "\rSix years ago when I was still living in Watown I found an old newspaper
      from 2077. In one of the articles there was a story about a new nuclear reactor.
      After reading that article, I started wandering around Old Zeeland until I
      found it under the FoodMart."
