  - choice: Are you really the last president of Old Zealand?
    reply: Yes, it's true. I was the last president of Old Zealand before that terrible
      nuclear war that changed our world. I survived it, and now I'm over 200 years
      old.

  - choice: How did you end up in this zombie village?
    reply: During the nuclear war, I hid on a nuclear-powered submarine. Only after
      coming ashore did I become a zombie and ended up here in Big Sandy, along with
      others who survived those dreadful times.

  - choice: How did the war happen, Mr. President?
    reply: The war was sudden, it lasted only a few hours. The United States was
      the first to release their nuclear warheads on the cities of Old Zealand. It
      was a day that is forever etched in my memory, a day that changed our world.

  - choice: What's this picture, Mr. President?
    reply: It's me, lad. I took it from my wrecked office when I was fleeing from
      the war. I wanted to keep it as a memento of those days when I was still the
      president of Old Zealand.
