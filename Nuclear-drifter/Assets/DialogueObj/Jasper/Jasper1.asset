  - choice: Hey, who are you and what are you doing here?
    reply: I'm Jasper, welcome to my secret lab under the lumberjack's hut. This
      is where I make Green ZEN, a drug in inhaler form. It enhances your accuracy
      in hitting enemies, increases chances for critical hits and shots, but it's
      highly addictive. One inhaler costs 25 dollars. Want to try?
