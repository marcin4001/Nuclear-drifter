  - choice: What can I do for you?
    reply: I'm a bounty hunter, bro. I want to get a machete from fisherman Steve.
      If you bring it to me, you get a passport for free. Steve lives in Woodhill.
      This settlement is southwest of here. I'm sure you were there. This machete
      is a really valuable thing. People say it brings luck to the fisherman. I want
      it in my collection.
