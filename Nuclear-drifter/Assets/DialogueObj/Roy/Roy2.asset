  - choice: What can I do for you?
    reply: I'm a bounty hunter, bro. I want to get a machete from Barry. If you bring
      it to me, you get your passport for free. Barry works at an inn between New
      Tolham and Watown. I'm sure you've been there. This machete is a really valuable
      thing. People say it brings luck to the innkeeper. I want it in my collection.
