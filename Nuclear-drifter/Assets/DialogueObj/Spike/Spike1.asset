  dialogues:
  - choice: How did you become a zombie?
    reply: During the atomic war, I was exposed to radiation while standing a mile
      away from the nuclear bomb explosion on land. This turned me into a zombie,
      just like many other people at that time. Most of them didn't survive, but
      I was lucky enough to make it through. Now I try to live my life the best I
      can, despite my condition.

  - choice: What type of vessel did you serve on before the war?
    reply: I served on an atomic-powered submarine, which was one of the most advanced
      military vessels I had the opportunity to operate. I was there for over 3 years
      and it was an intense but very rewarding job.

  - choice: Can I use the boat at the dock?
    reply: Of course, you can use the boat, but you need a paddle to row it. I sell
      paddles for $160, do you need one?
