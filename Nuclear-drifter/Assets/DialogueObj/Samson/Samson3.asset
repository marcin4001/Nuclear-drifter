  dialogues:
  - choice: Gordon sent me. Do you know where the uranium is yet?
    reply: Mmm, I see Gordon has a new errand boy. But yes, I have an idea where
      the uranium might be. Check the old subway east of Watown - that's likely where
      the uranium is hidden. I've managed to open the trapdoor at the entrance with
      a picklock. But be cautious, it's dangerous there. You'll definitely need a
      gas mask and a rope. Prepare well.

  - choice: What are you doing here?
    reply: I grow plants and supply them to other settlements. I grow mainly corns,
      carrots and mutapples. Mutapples are a new variety of apple that grew up after
      the war. These apples provide more vitamin C and are 3 times sweeter than pre-war
      apples.
