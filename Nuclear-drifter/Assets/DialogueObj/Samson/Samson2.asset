  - choice: What are you doing here?
    reply: I grow plants and supply them to other settlements. I grow mainly corns,
      carrots and mutapples. Mutapples are a new variety of apple that grew up after
      the war. These apples provide more vitamin C and are 3 times sweeter than pre-war
      apples.
