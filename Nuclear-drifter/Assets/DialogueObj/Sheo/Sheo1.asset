  - choice: What are you doing here?
    reply: "Me and my fianc\xE9e Juliet hunt hairy rhinos. We eat some of their meat
      and sell the rest to nearby settlements. After frying, their meat is much better
      than other meat."

  - choice: Why do you live far from settlements?
    reply: I prefer peace and quiet. Watown is too loud and crowded for me and Juliet.
      Besides, here we are closer to the rhino herds and we don't have to go home
      for a long time.

  - choice: Is there anything I can do for you?
    reply: Yes, a few days ago I found a beautiful vase by one of those strange statues.
      Unfortunately, I don't remember which statue the vase was by because I was
      drunk at the time. Find that vase and bring it here. I'll give you $50 for
      it.
