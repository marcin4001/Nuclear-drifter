  - choice: Tell me more about this Green Zen. How does it work?
    reply: Green Zen is a drug in inhaler form. It enhances your accuracy in hitting
      enemies, increases chances for critical hits and shots. But be careful, it's
      highly addictive. One inhaler costs 25 dollars. Want to try?
