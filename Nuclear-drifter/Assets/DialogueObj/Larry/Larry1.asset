  - choice: What are you doing here so far from the settlement?
    reply: Nothing interesting. I plant new trees and cut down old pre-war trees.
      Unfortunately, the leaves don't want to grow on any of the new trees.

  - choice: You seem sad. Is something wrong?
    reply: Yeah. I'm still afraid the bomb is near the bridge will explode. If that
      happens, our settlement will be destroyed. I told the other soldiers about
      it, but they don't see the problem. If anyone could disarm that bomb, I'd sleep
      soundly.
