  - choice: Can you tell me something about nuclear war?
    reply: The nuclear war began on November 14, 2089 and ended after 3 hours. The
      U.S. Army and Old Zealand used their entire nuclear arsenal in this battle.
      It was a total cataclysm! Is there anything else you would like to know?

  - choice: What is the geopolitical situation of this region?
    reply: For 200 years there was no war in this region. The United States took
      over Moolow Isles. The continent called Old Zealand belongs to people living
      in settlements. Each of the settlements has its own leader. There is no single
      government there.
