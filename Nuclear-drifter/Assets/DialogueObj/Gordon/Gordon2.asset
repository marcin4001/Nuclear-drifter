  - choice: What happened to the people of this island?
    reply: There were no fatalities on the Moolow Islands. The only bomb that hit
      the island didn't explode. All the people you see here are the great-grandchildren
      of the US soldiers who conquered this island. The island was conquered in 2087.

      Other people died or turned into zombies. In 2229 people left the subway and
      started to build their settlements.

  - choice: What was the reason for the beginning of the war?
    reply: The main cause of the war was the dispute over the last uranium deposits
      in the world. The United States discovered a large deposit of this material
      on the continent. The government of Old Zealand did not want to agree to the
      extraction. And so this 30-year conflict began.
