  - choice: Can I help you with something?
    reply: Yeah, you can bring me 12 rhino horns. This is a very important material
      for me to create talismans and other jewelry. Can you hunt 12 rhinos for me
      and bring me their horns? After my last adventure I don't want to leave home
      for long journeys.
