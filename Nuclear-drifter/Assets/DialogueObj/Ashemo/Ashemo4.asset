  - choice: "\rWhere is Watown?"
    reply: The Watown settlement is east of here. It's the largest settlement on
      the continent. I'm sure you'll find it. The settlement is ruled by my brother
      Joshua. He's gonna help you.

  - choice: Where is Yorkset?
    reply: "The Yorkset settlement is northeast of here. It's a settlement by the
      ocean. The arrogant Jaxon is the leader of this settlement. I advise you to
      avoid this place for now. \rYou'd better go to Watown, young man."

  - choice: "\rTell me about New Tolham."
    reply: New Tolham is a settlement by the ocean, which I founded many years ago.
      Here you'll find a hotel with free rooms, a grocery store and the Jason shepherd's
      house. Besides, there's nothing interesting about it. If you want more attractions,
      go to Watown.

  - choice: "\rCan you remind me what I have to do for you."
    reply: Okay. Bring me a pack of masks from Thomas of Moolow Isles. Moolow Isles
      is north of here. You take care of yourself. There's a radiation area on the
      way to the island.
