  - choice: "\rWhere is Watown?"
    reply: The Watown settlement is east of here. It's the largest settlement on
      the continent. I'm sure you'll find it. The settlement is ruled by my brother
      Joshua. He's gonna help you.

  - choice: Where is Yorkset?
    reply: "The Yorkset settlement is northeast of here. It's a settlement by the
      ocean. The arrogant Jaxon is the leader of this settlement. I advise you to
      avoid this place for now. \rYou'd better go to Watown, young man.\n"

  - choice: "\rTell me about New Tolham."
    reply: New Tolham is a settlement by the ocean, which I founded many years ago.
      Here you'll find a hotel with free rooms, a food market and the Jason shepherd's
      house. Besides, there's nothing interesting about it. If you want more attractions,
      go to Watown.

  - choice: "\rCan I do something for you?"
    reply: I have a job for a traveler. A month ago I ordered anti-radiation masks
      from Moolow Isles. I need them for my people and guards because there's radiation
      area north of here. I have to take care of the health of the people. Can you
      get me that package?
