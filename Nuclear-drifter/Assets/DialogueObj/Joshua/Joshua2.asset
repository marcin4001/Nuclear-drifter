  - choice: How long ago was this settlement established?
    reply: I founded Watown 40 years ago, after I got my father's inheritance. My
      father was a Overseer of the main station of the subway station in Old Zealand
      after the nuclear war. After leaving the subway, father founded Woodhill, divided
      the estate and went south. Watown is the largest settlement in Old Zealand.
