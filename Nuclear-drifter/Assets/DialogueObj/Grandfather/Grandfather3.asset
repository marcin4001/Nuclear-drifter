  - choice: How do you get to these uranium deposits?
    reply: There is a key in the chest that opens the trapdoor. There are service
      tunnels under the trapdoors. Behind the last tunnel door are uranium deposits.
      Be careful in the tunnels. The wagons in this tunnel are still radiating.
