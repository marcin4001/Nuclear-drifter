  - choice: I want to buy a lockpick. ($20)
    reply: Opening a lock requires using a lockpick. Place the lockpick in the lock
      and gently turn it until you hear five clicks. That means the lock has been
      opened. You can buy a lockpick from me for $20.

  - choice: Is there anything interesting on the island?
    reply: In fact, the only interesting thing on the island is the gun store. Besides,
      there are only soldier houses. You can ask the guys if they have any work for
      you if you want to make money here. I have nothing for you to do.
