  - choice: What happened to you, soldier?
    reply: I was on a wolf hunt and was caught by mutant flies. Unfortunately, local
      flies are venomous, so they poisoned me. I almost didn't come back home, because
      the flies bit me so much. I need the Antidote, and there is not a doctor in
      this settlement. If you could, bring me the Antidote from the continent.
