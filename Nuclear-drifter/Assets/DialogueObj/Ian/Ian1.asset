  - choice: "\rWhat's your job, soldier?"
    reply: I have to patrol the settlement area, stranger. I have been doing this
      myself for several days, because my friend has gone missing. It is a terribly
      boring job.

  - choice: Can I do something for you?
    reply: If you can, find my friend alive or dead. My friend went to look for treasures
      in the south of here. He said something about the Woodhill settlement and the
      radiation area next door. You should be looking for him there. If he's dead,
      bring me his soldier tag. My friend's name is Ted.
