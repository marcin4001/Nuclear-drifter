  - choice: Your friend is dead. Here is his soldier tag.
    reply: Oh no. I feel sorry for that guy. Now I'm gonna have to patrol the area
      myself until I fucking die. That's for you - 2 bottles of Rad Killer. I'm sure
      you've been well irradiated there.

  - choice: "\rWhat's your job, soldier?"
    reply: I have to patrol the settlement area, stranger. I have been doing this
      myself for several days, because my friend has gone missing. It is a terribly
      boring job.
