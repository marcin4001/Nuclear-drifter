  dialogues:
  - choice: How did you become a zombie?
    reply: It's a long story. In short, I was a regular farmer who got irradiated
      by the fallout from an atomic bomb explosion. Luckily or unluckily, depending
      on your point of view, I survived and became a zombie. For over 200 years,
      I've been growing corn and doing everything in my power to stay alive.
