  - choice: I brought you the Atomic Flakes you asked for.
    reply: Perfect! Thank you very much for your help. As a token of my gratitude,
      I'd be happy to sell you a few packages of Atomic Flakes at half price, which
      I'll create myself. I have plenty of corn, so I'll be able to produce my own
      flakes based on these Atomic Flakes.

  - choice: How did you become a zombie?
    reply: It's a long story. In short, I was a regular farmer who got irradiated
      by the fallout from an atomic bomb explosion. Luckily or unluckily, depending
      on your point of view, I survived and became a zombie. For over 200 years,
      I've been growing corn and doing everything in my power to stay alive.
