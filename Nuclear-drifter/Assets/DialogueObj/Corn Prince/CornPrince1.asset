  - choice: How did you become a zombie?
    reply: It's a long story. In short, I was a regular farmer who got irradiated
      by the fallout from an atomic bomb explosion. Luckily or unluckily, depending
      on your point of view, I survived and became a zombie. For over 200 years,
      I've been growing corn and doing everything in my power to stay alive.

  - choice: Is there anything I can do for you?
    reply: Sure, you can help me. I need to get my hands on a box of Atomic Flakes
      to learn their composition and start producing my own flakes. These corn flakes
      were very popular before the war, and I hope to restore their former quality.
      Can you help me get the Atomic Flakes?
