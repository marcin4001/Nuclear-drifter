  - choice: Why aren't you hunting right now?
    reply: I can't hunt because my camp by the mine was overtaken by aggressive zombies.
      They drove me out, so now I'm hiding out in Big Sandy.

  - choice: Is there anything I can do for you?
    reply: Since you're asking, how about taking care of those damn zombies? I see
      you're well-equipped, so you should be able to handle it. My camp is northwest
      from here, at the mine's entrance.
