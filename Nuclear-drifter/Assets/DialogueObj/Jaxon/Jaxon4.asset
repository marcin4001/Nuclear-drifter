  - choice: What happens when the cigarettes run out?
    reply: Then we will start making the cigarettes ourselves. I bought 2 tons of
      tobacco from Americans. It will be enough for us for a long time.

  - choice: When and how was this settlement established?
    reply: Yorkset is a young settlement that I founded. I was the richest man in
      New Tolham and could not communicate with Ashemo, the leader of the settlement,
      on management matters. Ten years ago I took a few people and we built this
      settlement together. Since then, Ashemo hates me. That's the whole story.

  - choice: Can I do something for you?
    reply: Yes, you can get my old tomahawk back for me. I lost it northeast of Yorkset
      when I fought a rhino. It should still be lying next to that snarling beast.
      If you can find it, it's very important to me.
